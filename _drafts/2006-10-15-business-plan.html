Man, starting a business is rough.  I mean I can handle the computers and the systems and the electronic litter all over the place, but creating a Business Plan - WOW! That's Hard! <br /><br />I know that people have speciallities and that some people look at a computer and panic.  Now I know how they feel.  I have all these ideas and thoughts in my head, but when I sit down to put them in to the BP (see, I'm even applying TLAs to it!) they just scatter.  Kind of like when you go into a music store you can't remember any artist that you like.<br /><br />All I know is that I have a new found respect for business people that can sit down and shovel out this drivel all day long.  I think my personal hell would be to sit in a small cubical, with a coat &amp; tie on, and prepare documentation all day long.  My current job is not too far from that, but at least I can wear jeans - or rather I can wear jeans as long as they don't say anything to me about it. <br /><br />sigh...
