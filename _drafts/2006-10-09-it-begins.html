Well, I have been thinking quite a bit lately about communication and<br />I have realized that I have been doing very poorly at it.  :(  Sorry.<br />This blog is to make up for that.  I plan on putting my thoughts out<br />here for you guys to read and respond to.  And if you feel the need,<br />I'll add you as authors and you can join in the thought process.<br /><br />This is supposed to be "private" so that the general public can't see<br />it or find it.  I think I'll hold off a little bit on the confidential<br />stuff until we can be more certain.  :)  If it turns out that we can't<br />lock it down or you guys can't read it from work|home or whatever,<br />then we'll look at hosting it on the KangarooBox.com box.  My overall<br />plan is to take advantage of as many "on-line" "Software As A Service"<br />things as I can, and I think this is a pretty good start.<br /><br />Please let me know what you think and if it's a good idea or not.  I<br />don't think email was working for us (my thoughts come out too fast<br />and I don't want to bury you guys in a deluge of tiny ideas :) and I<br />had the idea of this blog while mowing grass this afternoon.  And so,<br />it begins...
