Since the LLC will be finalized soon I thought that we might all get together (with spouses, if applicable) to talk about the future of the company.  I would like to use this opportunity to answer any &amp; all questions that anyone has.  Everyone needs to be on board and comfortable with our decision to move forward.<br /><br />I am already committed to doing this; I don't think I can continue to work for someone else much longer.  The past 6 months have been pretty bad on me.  :/  Going to work and not telling anyone anything has been pretty tough and every day I have to think of reasons not to leave.  KangarooBox is my future.  It's what I'm going to do for the rest of my work life.  It's what I am going to retire from.  I know it sounds pretty corny, but I really do believe that we have something special and that it will work if we work hard and be honest with ourselves.  As long as we "Do no evil" (Google Â® :) and keep to the Open Source mentality, we'll make money hand over fist.<br /><br />So, what do you say to dinner at Tumbleweed/Applebees/Olive Garden/etc.?  I would like to do this before the end of October so that we can get focused again.  Say, next Saturday Oct 21st.  Let me know.<br /><br />Later...<br />Richard
