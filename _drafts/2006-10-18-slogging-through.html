Well, I just "completed" the Marketing Plan section of the Business Plan.  I have begun to break the plan up into sections to make it more manageable.  Maybe I can work on one section at a time easier than I can tackle the whole document at once.  So far so good.  And it seems like LaTeX really helps in this regard.  You just start a new .tex document and /input{} it into the main document.  Easy.  Also, the editor I'm using (TexMaker) makes it even easier by being able to mark a specific document as a "master" document.  When you compile it all just works - like magic.  :)<br /><br />Just 5 more sections to go.  Then I get to shop it around to the local banks and see if we get any nibbles.  Even more fun.  Hey, who's idea was it to start this business anyway!?
