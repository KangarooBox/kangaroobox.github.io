          Richard has been programming computers since he was 7 years old.  Spending all day at the local
          Radio Shack playing with the new Color Computer models and learning all about loops and if..then..else
          statements was a day spent well.  After graduating from
          <a href="http://louisville.edu/speed">JB Speed School of Engineering</a> with a degree in Information
          Science and Data Processing he started writing computer programs in the business world.

          Eventually he couldn't resist the siren call of entrepreneurship and he left the corporate world behind
          and started KangarooBox.  This new company would make <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>T</strong>echnology
          easy to understand and use for the less technically inclined.
