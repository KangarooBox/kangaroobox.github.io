" border="0" /></a>Great news!  KangarooBox is sponsoring the Pre-Event Party for the <a href="http://ohiolinux.org/" title="The sixth annual Ohio LinuxFest will be on October 10 - 11, 2008 at the Greater Columbus Convention Center, in downtown Columbus, Ohio. ">Ohio LinuxFest</a> and we're giving away free T-Shirts to commemorate the event.  Come on down to <a href="http://www.barleysbrewing.com/downtown/index.htm">Barley's Brewing Companay</a> and say "hi!"<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to meeting with all the folks there and can't wait to here some of the speakers.  With talks on Xen, iSCSI, Drupal, and Robotics whats not to love?  Jon "maddog" Hall is going to give a talk on Sustainable Computing.  I'm guessing that it will be standing room only.<br /><br />See ya there!
