So there I was doing my part to save the dolphins when I cut my finger and passed out.  Nothing big right?  Well, I didn't think so but everyone got a good laugh and I think I'm getting safety scissors and toy dolphins for Christmas this year, so that's not good.  :)<br /><br />Anyway, you know those plastic things that 20 oz. soda bottles are wrapped up with?  I was cutting the rings out of them so that fish &amp; other creatures don't get caught in them and die of starvation or whatever.  I'm happily cutting along when *snip* my finger got in the way.  It's not a bad cut but the blood does start to flow, so I grab a paper napkin and put some pressure on it.  Searching the office for a band-aid I realize that I don't have anything like that and I need to go to a neighbor for help.  I finally get one from the nice lady in the CPA office down the hall.<br /><br />While I'm there I start to feel light-headed and ask to sit down.  As I'm telling her the story of how I pass out sometimes at the sight of my own blood I pass out.  Great.  And to top it all off my limbs start twitching (cause that happens sometimes according to Wikipedia) and I scare this poor lady half to death.<br /><br />I finally come around and she gives me some water and asks if I need to go to the hospital or anything.  I thank her profusely and call my parents to come get me.  My body didn't like passing out very much and I don't think I should drive.  I get home and rest and everything is good.  All's well that ends well, right?  Wrong.<br /><br />My wife and mother-in-law find out about my experience and are, at first, very concerned.  However, when they found out that I had passed out after just nicked my finger with scissors they have a good laugh at my expense.  It's OK though, I'm used to it.  This story just joins the others, like the one about the 3 year old throwing sand in my face.  That one always gets a laugh out of everyone.  I'm  not bitter though.  No, not me.
