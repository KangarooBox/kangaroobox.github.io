<h3><a href="http://www.my-programming.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/what-is-programming-language.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://www.my-programming.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/what-is-programming-language.jpg" width="200" /></a>Introduction</h3>I frequently ask myself what languages are on top in my mind. &nbsp;In the past I've loved almost everything from PowerBuilder to Perl to Java. &nbsp;There are a couple of languages I've really disliked (looking at you Cobol) but I don't have to work with them much so its not much of a problem. &nbsp;Anyway, here's what I would use to build something today.<br /><h3>Things I would use</h3><h4>Ruby</h4><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is very solid in my mind and is my go-to language for almost any job. &nbsp;It's been criticized in the past as slow and awkward but those days are gone and today's Ruby is a joy to work with. &nbsp;I love the syntax of the language and how everything seems to be named properly. &nbsp;I rarely have to look up documentation as my first guess is usually correct. &nbsp;It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">irb</a> / P<a href="http://vimeo.com/26391171">ry</a>) is beyond compare and almost removes the need to debug. &nbsp;I once thought that nothing could rival the Java JAR ecosystem, but I think that Ruby Gems is more extensive, more modern, and beats it in almost every way that counts.<br /><h4>Go</h4><a href="http://golang.com/">Go</a> has really peaked my interest in the last 6 months or so. &nbsp;There are more and more people talking it up and several companies releasing major projects that are written in Go. &nbsp;The upsides are plenty, from a fresh, clean syntax, to the out-of-the-box tools (gofmt, gofix, etc.), to the performance. &nbsp;The community is very active and its backed by a major computing powerhouse (<a href="http://google.com/">Google</a>). &nbsp;Still, its a fairly new and immature language and I think you would be hard pressed to get your company to start building mission critical apps in it. &nbsp;Well, unless your company is forward thinking and willing to take some risks to get major awards.<br /><h4>Java</h4><a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a> was in my toolbox for a long time but anymore I just really don't like using it. &nbsp;Sure, it's fast and can run almost anywhere and has lots of libraries, but it just leaves me empty. &nbsp;I think my feelings turned when Sun was sold to Oracle and I saw the writing on the wall. &nbsp;Since then it just seems like the world has abandoned the language, along with Oracle. &nbsp;The fact that most Java code is "enterprise"-ready doesn't really help matters. &nbsp;Most of the Java code I see in the wild is ultimately flexible and ready to be used for almost any purpose. &nbsp;It's also nested so deeply that it's extremely hard to follow the code logic and I'm afraid to touch it. &nbsp;That said, it's not really the languages fault that people write it that way<br /><h3>Don't even look at me</h3><h4>PHP</h4><div>What can I say about <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> that hasn't <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">been said before</a>? &nbsp;I think it has uses in quick and dirty projects, but using it for anything of production value is just a fools errand. &nbsp;Worse than that I firmly believe that writing PHP is bad for your programmer brain. &nbsp;It teaches the wrong things and guides you down the wrong paths. &nbsp;Hell, they put a <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php">"goto" operator</a> into the language in 2009! &nbsp;Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/06/the-php-singularity.html">commented</a> that the way to make PHP go away is to provide better alternatives, and I believe that Ruby is finally becoming that alternative. &nbsp;Its easier to write, faster, and easier to deploy (Bundler). &nbsp;Hosting solutions (<a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>) and cloud providers (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">AWS OpsWorks</a>) are building one button deploy systems that match or exceed PHP's.</div><h3>Wrap-up</h3><div>Look, my point is that there is no one solution for every job. &nbsp;Next time you start a project take a long hard look at the problem you are solving and pick the best tool. &nbsp;Ruby is great for small utilities, miscellaneous web based work and (with&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>) the perfect solution for CRUD websites. &nbsp;It even works for game programming and writing <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">iOS applications</a>. &nbsp;I find Go a perfect fit for heavy duty server systems (image processing, number crunching, etc.) &nbsp;Do what fits your job and makes you happy.</div>
