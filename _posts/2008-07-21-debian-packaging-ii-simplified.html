In my last post I showed a fairly complex command line that parses the output of <code>licensecheck</code> into something more usable for the new <code>debian/copyright</code> format.  The problem was that it didn't quite work properly and it was too complex to modify.  So, I took a different approach and modified the <code>licensecheck</code> program directly.  Yea, open source!<br /><br />Here is my simple but working patch for the <code>licensecheck</code> program.  Enjoy.<br /><br /><pre><br />--- licensecheck        2008-06-29 08:53:10.000000000 -0400<br />+++ licensecheck        2008-07-21 12:44:03.000000000 -0400<br />@@ -288,12 +288,11 @@<br />     $content =~ tr/ //s;<br /> <br />     $license = parselicense($content);<br />-    print "$file: ";<br />+    print $license .

This will hopefully make it easier to build and maintain my copyright file for my redmine package.
