It looks like NewEgg realized it had a problem, informed its customers about it, and is working to prevent it from happening again.<br /><br />I would like to thank NewEgg for going out of their way to communicate a problem they were having with their customers.  This goes a long way with me toward showing me that they are a good company and that I should continue to utilize them.  I purchase quite a lot from them and am happy with the way they have dealt with this minor situation.<br /><br />Here is the text of their apology:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Dear e-Blast Subscriber,</span><br />     <br />       <span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We apologize to those of you who experienced some technical difficulties when trying to open today's edition of the Newegg e-Blast Newsletter. One of our servers was temporarily down, causing the e-Blast to display incorrectly for some recipients.<br />     <br />The e-Blast is now running correctly again, and we would like to reassure you that this was a purely internal technical issue—none of your private information has been accessed or leaked outside our secure network. We take our customers’ privacy very seriously and have run a thorough check to ensure that your personal data has not in any way been compromised, so please rest assured.<br />     <br />This morning’s temporary server failure is an extremely rare occurrence at Newegg and we are putting additional measures in place to ensure a similar problem will not occur again. We apologize for the inconvenience this morning’s technical difficulties may have caused you and thank you for your understanding and patience with the situation.<br />    <br />     Sincerely,      <br />     <br />      The Newegg e-Blast Team </span>
