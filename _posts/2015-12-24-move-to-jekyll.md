Well, I've officially moved off of Blogspot and onto [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) hosted on Github and I have nothing but good things
to say about it.  Blogspot was great in the beginning as it made it super easy to get a blog up and running
with very little effort.  However, lately it's been feeling a bit run down.  Blogspot doesn't seem to get
any attention from Google at all and it shows.  Even loading a simple blog post page seems to be very, very
slow.  I don't know if it's all the stuff going on in the background, or Javascript on the page, or what, but
it really shouldn't take that long to render a simple, static page.

Luckily, Jekyll came alone and showed us the error of our ways.  It's fast, easy to deploy, and it makes
creating posts fun again.  The only thing it doesn't do well is dynamic content (like comments) so I
also hooked up Disqus to handle comments and that seems to be working really well.

Hopefully, I'll be posting more info on some AWS goodies (and other things) I'm currently working on.

BTW: Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays!  :)
