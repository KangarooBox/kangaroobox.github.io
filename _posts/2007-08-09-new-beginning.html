Well, KangarooBox is officially started.  We got the funding we needed and I'm in the process of booting up the office.  Painting is done; furniture is slowing coming along; appliances are next.  I have to have a refrigerator to make ice, and you have to have ice to make sweet tea, and I have to have sweet tea to live!<br /><br />I've also had a new 30Amp circuit installed for the new UPS.  Well, it's going to be new to us - thank ${DEITY} for <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>!  I think I'm going to outfit 80% of the office with things from the online auction giant.  About the only thing I'm buying new is the aforementioned refrigerator and my main computer, a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">Apple MacBook Pro</a>.  Which reminds me, I have to go and build a business accounting system with Quickbooks Pro.  Grrrr...  :)
