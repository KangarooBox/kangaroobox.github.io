On our recent family vacation to <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachinfo.com/">Myrtle Beach, SC</a> I got to playing with a new content management system called <a href="http://www.silverstripe.com/">SilverStripe</a>.  In a nutshell, a CMS is a way to make web pages.  Specifically its a framework designed to make it easy to make a lot of web pages with a bunch of functionality.  A CMS makes building things like Blogs &amp; Forums and tying them together with a bunch of ofther pages easy.  Hit the link above and check it out.<br /><br />Anyway, <a href="http://www.kangaroobox.com/">KangarooBox</a> currently uses a Ruby on Rails CMS called <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> and while it does a pretty good job I'm not completely happy with it.  By design Radiant is very lightweight and isn't as full featured as SilverStripe.  Thats not a bad thing and it served me very well in the beginning.  However, my needs are greater now and SilverStripe looks like it might fit the bill quite nicely.  A couple of the features I'm looking forward to are the Forums support and real Shopping Cart functionality.  We'll be ready to start selling products soon and I need a way for people to buy stuff from us.  That's really the point behind this whole thing.  :)<br /><br />BTW: Who here thinks it's extremely geeky of me to install CMSs while on a beach vacation?  :/
