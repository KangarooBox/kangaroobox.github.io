I just signed up with <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/">SaveTheInternet</a> to post <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/yourstory/398349">my story</a> and plead for Net Neutrality.  I firmly believe that in order for the Internet to continue to grow and mature it has to be free of artificial limits on who can move data around it.  If you haven't already, please consider joining the fight and telling your story.  Just hit the link above and fill out a couple of forms.  It's easy and it will hopefully make the FCC  sit up and take notice of what we want.<br /><br />Thanx!<br /> Richard<br /><br /><a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/yourstory"><br /><img src="http://www.savetheinternet.com/graphics/sti_tys.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Save the Internet: Tell Your Story" border="0" /></a>
