Recently, I needed to expand the hard drive on my Ubuntu VirtualBox guest machine from 8GB to 20GB.&nbsp; At first it looked like I was going to have to start from scratch, but a little Googling turned up this gem (which I stole from the <a href="http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=364&amp;sid=0f6c731729f2cc73f48c473d11710606&amp;start=90">VirtualBox forums</a>)<br /><blockquote>#VBoxManage createhd -filename new.vdi --size 20000 --remember<br />#VBoxManage clonehd old.vdi new.vdi --existing</blockquote>After the clone operation gets finished you just need to replace the old hard drive with the new on in VirtualBox and start the guest instance.&nbsp; The only thing that tripped me up is that the guest didn't immediately "see" the bigger hard drive.&nbsp; Well, to be more precise the hard drive was bigger but the partition was still set to 8GB.&nbsp; As quick boot into GParted did the trick and now I have room to move again on my VM.&nbsp; :)
