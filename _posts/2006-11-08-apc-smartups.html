Grrrr...  OK, I think I'm almost over being angry at <a href="http://www.apcc.com">APC</a>.  We have one of their SmartUPS 3000 systems installed at <a href="http://www.ndasaints.org">school</a> and the other day it turned itself off!<br /><br />The story so far: A couple of years ago we purchased a used SmartUPS 3000RM on eBay to condition the power and keep the systems running in case anything happened at school.  We put new batteries in it and everything was hunky-dory.  Fast forward to last week - the "bad battery" light had been on for a while but everything was still running fine.  I figured that we needed to replace the battery and would probably do it over the Christmas holiday.  However, the UPS had other plans.  Apparently, the non-enterprise APC systems don't fail closed, they fail open!!  So, if the battery goes bad the system shuts down completely!!<br /><br />We used to use Visual Source Safe for version control.  Then one day we discovered that it was silently corrupting our files because a hard drive filled up and that was the end of VSS. <br /><br />A version control system's job is to keep your files safe - NO MATTER WHAT!  If it can't do that, it's worse than useless. <br /><br />A UPS's job is to keep the power on - NO MATTER WHAT!  If it can't do that, it's worse than useless. <br /><br />Given that, I don't think I'll be purchasing any APC products for roobox.  Someone pointed out that the midrange <a href="http://www.liebert.com/dynamic/catprodlist.asp?pid=19&cycles=60HZ">Liebert</a>  systems operate correctly even when the battery dies.  I think I'll check them out
