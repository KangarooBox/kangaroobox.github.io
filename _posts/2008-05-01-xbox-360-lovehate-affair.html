OK, I'll be honest with you - I don't really like the XBox 360.  I really like some of the games (Halo {2|3}) but the console sucks.  There are so many things wrong with it that I don't know where to start.  Wait, yes I do.  Last week I got a visit from the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems#General_hardware_failure">RROD</a> monster.  :(  That just tops off my list of complaints about the system, some of which are:<br /><ul><li>It's insanely loud!  Any time your playing a game the fan sounds like an F16 fighter taking off.  Sitting at the dashboard it's not too bad, but pop in a game and I have to crank the TV volume up to 11.</li><li>XBox Live going down whenever people log in.  This past Christmas season it was down more than it was up.  Microsoft blames this on the influx of new subscribers and I can understand that but it's not like these people just popped out of nowhere.  Here's a tip for you Microsoft, when you sell more XBox 360 consoles your probably going to have more people log into XBox Live.  It's not like this is something that we're getting for free and we shouldn't complain.  Waiting around for you to get your stuff together is costing me $50 a year.</li><li>XBox Live costing me $50 a year.  How do Sony and Nintendo get away with free network access?  Are you really that greedy?<br /></li><li>Red Ring Of Death!  Enough said.</li></ul>Now you might ask why I continue down the XBox 360 path and up until now the answer was simple: GAMES!  I like the Wii well enough but most of the games just don't really appeal to me.  I currently like hardcore, multiplayer, shooter games and those are few and far between on the Wii.  The Playstation 3 is in a similar situation.  Not only is it WAY too expensive, it has just been completly void of games for a long time.  However, that is changing and it's looking like more and more games that I like are ending up on Sony's platform.<br /><br />I'm probably not going to switch platforms just yet, but I'm putting Microsoft on notice; as soon as I find something, anything better than your crappy platform I'm saying goodby to Halo.
