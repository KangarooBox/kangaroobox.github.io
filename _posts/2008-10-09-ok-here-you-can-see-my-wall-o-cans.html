I'm just wondering, do you think I drink too much soda for one person?  Remember, this wall is about 6 months old and is two rows deep.  And I only work on it when I'm at the office (which is most days, but not all day long).<br /><br />Do I have a problem?  Should I visit SA (Soda Anonymous)?  If you think that is a lot of cans, you should see my <a href="http://www.altoids.com/index.do">Altoids</a> collection.  Whew!!<br /><br />EDIT: I really wish that Mountain Dew <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO-J5ImDEi8">Game Fuel</a> was still being made.  That soda <a href="http://www.energyfiend.com/2007/04/halo-3-mountain-dew-game-fuel">rocked</a>!
