I realized that I have been collecting pictures of the office and other things around here but don't really have anywhere to share them.  I'm hoping to use this new account to post some interesting pics of whats going on at the time.  Like showing you my Christmas decorations, as pitiful as they are.<br /><br />Hmmm...on second thought maybe I shouldn't show these pictures.  :)
