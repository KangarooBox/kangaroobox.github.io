Let me say that I have zero experience in building Debian packages and I really didn't want to start off this way.  But since I need it for my business I guess there is no way around it.  Oh well, I guess its a good learning experience.<br /><br />I'll try to keep this blog up-to-date with my progress.  I'm actually kinda looking forward to it.
