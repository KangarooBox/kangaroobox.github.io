Why, oh why do Flash video players not work properly?  I mean, I'm on a reasonably powerful Mac Book Pro running the latest browsers and Flash plug-in and <span style="font-weight: bold;">still</span> YouTube videos are almost unwatchable (for reasons other than the content :).  Can no one save us from the horror that is Flash video?  Am I missing something somewhere that makes video smooth and watchable?  The audio works just fine but the video breaks and jumps like crazy.<br /><br />Its not a buffering issue, because no matter where I view it (home DLS, work T1) it still has the same performance.  I have also fully buffered the videos before viewing them and even that didn't help things.  Its also not a Mac problem as the same thing happens under Linux (no surprise) and Windows.<br /><br />I realize that HTML 5 has a video tag built-in, but I don't think I can wait that long.  :/
