      <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target=_blank>Cloudformation</a> (CFN)
        is the best way to manage and provision your AWS resources.  Building CFN templates is
        not hard but they can be quick tricky to implement and can grow to be very long indeed.
        3,000+ lines of JSON is not an easy thing to master.  That's where
        <a href="https://github.com/KangarooBox/cfn-builder" target=_blank>CFN Builder</a> comes into play.

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/KangarooBox/cfn-builder" target=_blank>CFN Builder</a> is a NodeJS templating
        engine that takes simple JSON "blueprints" and generates complete CFN templates, ready to upload into AWS.
        It automatically combines global variables, such as your VPC Id, with loops and other structures to make
        templating new stacks easy.  If you used native CFN templates, you'll love the freedom that
        <a href="https://github.com/KangarooBox/cfn-builder" target=_blank>CFN Builder</a> give you.
